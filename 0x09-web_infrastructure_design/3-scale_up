The additional elements in the infrastructure are:
	1. 1 Server
	2. 1 load-balancer
	3. Components are split from their own servers

	1. The addition of one server improves the reliability of the infras-
	   structure since more traffic can be handled and there is more redu-
	   ndancy in case of device failure
	2. The addition of a load-balancer  will improve the infrastructure as 
	   this will make the load balancer not be a SPOF anymore.
	3. Components are split from their own servers so as to address the issue
	   observed in the previous design whereby servers have same components.
	   As noted this may lead to problem when their is a mismatch in config-
	   uration of the components. By sharing the same web servers, app ser-
 	   vers and database, the two servers will always have access to the same
	   logic and data.
