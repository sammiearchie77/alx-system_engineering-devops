### Author: Ruhullahi Muhammad

## Synopsis
This project applies newly learned concepts about web infrastructure.

### At the end of this project students should be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:
*   You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
*   You must be able to explain what are each component doing
*   You must be able to explain system redundancy
*   Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

### Resources
Task #0:

*   [What is a database](http://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/database)
*   [DNS record types](https://pressable.com/blog/2014/12/23/dns-record-types-explained/)
*   [Single point of failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)

Task #1:

*   [How to avoid downtime when deploying new code](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/35063/how-do-you-update-your-production-codebase-database-schema-without-causing-downt#answers-header)
*   [High availability cluster (active-active/active-passive)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17904_01/core.1111/e10106/intro.htm#ASHIA712)

Task #2:

## Requirements:


### Project Requirements
*   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
*   For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
*   This project will be manually reviewed:
	*   As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
	*   Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](http://imgur.com/) but feel free to use anything you want).
	*   For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
	*   After pushing your answer file to Github, insert the Github file link into the URL box
*   You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
	*   Focus on what you are being asked:
	*   Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
	*   Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
	*   Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
	*   In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked
